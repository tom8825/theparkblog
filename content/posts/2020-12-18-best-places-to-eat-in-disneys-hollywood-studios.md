Disney's Hollywood Studios has been given a lot of love over the last 10 years, some of this love has come in the form of two new expansions -- Toy Story Land and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.

We have put together a list of our favourite quick service and table service restaurants in Hollywood Studios. For those not familiar with their differences, quick service meals are those meals where you typically order from a cashier, pick up your food at a counter, and find your own seat.

Nestled between Toy Story Mania and Slinky Dog Dash in Toy Story Land, Woody's Lunch Box serves up a variety comfort food that will make you feel like a child again. The menu includes s’more French toast sandwiches, seasonal lemon-blueberry lunch box tarts, and the delicious tater tot-nacho combination called “totchos”.

We enjoyed the food and eventually managed to find seating, but we struggled to find cover which could be an issue during hot or wet days.

50’s Prime Time Café is known as much, if not more, for its theming than its food. Step back into the 50s with black-and-white TVs with era-relevant shows being played and vintage decor, but don’t forget your manners or table etiquette as servers are ready to 'dole out punishment to misbehaving boys and girls'.

The menu consists of Mom's favourites such as meatloaf, pot roast, chicken pot pie, and a host of milkshakes.
