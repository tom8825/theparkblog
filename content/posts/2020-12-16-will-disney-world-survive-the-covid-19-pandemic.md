Disney World is considered by many to be onw of the happiest places on earth but, right now, things are looking increasingly gloomy as the coronavirus pandemic has put an economic dent in Disney's wallet, and they're not the only parks to feel the pinch.

With a massive reduction in traffic, Orlando tourist spots are suffering record losses, and there are fears this could worsen with closures during the autumn and winter months.

After a rocky spring, fingers were crossed for a boost in July when the Disney parks reopened, however this was short lived as holiday makers were still cautious about travelling due to the pandemic or put off by limited park attractions being open.

In September Disney made the "heart-breaking" decision to lay off around 28,000 with an additional 4,000 by March 2021 employees due to the impact of the pandemic. Universal Orlando also announced in November that 1,223 team members from their creative division would be made redundant. The assumption is that SeaWorld and other parks will have been taking similar measures to cut costs in the last few months.

It’s not all doom and gloom though for Disney World and the other Florida parks. SeaWorld says bookings are way up for next year compared to 2020. And the Disney Plus streaming service hit 60 million subscribers, which it hadn’t expected to do until 2024. Towards the end of November Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure both hit capacity on the same day.

So, demand and footfall is steadily returning while more COVID-19 vaccines are approved and rolled out. But while the road to recovery is long and winding, we are confident that we are confident that people can start looking forward to their holidays fairly soon.
